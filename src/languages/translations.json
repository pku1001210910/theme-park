      "ride-001": "The coaster will reach 109 feet at its tallest peak and send riders through 16 airtime hills. Mystic Timbers is themed as an abandoned lumber mill and is expected to end in a grand special effects finale in a mysterious shed covered in vines.",
      "ride-002": "Williamsburg’s first wooden roller coaster is actually more of a hybrid. The ride is a “hybrid wooden coaster with steel supports” that sends riders down a 74-foot drop and over nine air-time hills. The ride, which is themed after a Viking invasion, can reach up to 48 miles per hour.",
      "ride-003": "For those who like a bit of education with their attractions, Pier 39’s newest ride will take visitors on a tour of San Francisco. The Flyer is a “28-seat flying theater” that will take guests over the San Francisco skyline, across the Golden Gate Bridge and onto Alcatraz Island using a massive movie screen and 3-D tech."
